## Acknowledgement
I would like to sincerely thank Dr. John Holash for his guidance and support throughout KNES 381. His teaching helped me develop important academic and professional skills, and encouraged me to grow with confidence. Many of the skills demonstrated on this website were developed through his instruction, and I am grateful for his continued encouragement and mentorship.
